## Presentation

This project aims to assess the possibility to use the cloud native services from AWS and Azure to create a new dataset.  We will test the result of a sentiment analysis on tweetswith machine learning model.  We will compare three models trained on different dataset.The first model will use the ground truth label from the original dataset.  The second willbe  trained  on  the  dataset  created  with  the  label  from  the  cloud  services.   The  third  willbe an unsupervised model.  We compared the result on a given test set and found that thesupervised model trained on the new dataset from the cloud services yields result very closeto the one trained on the original dataset.
